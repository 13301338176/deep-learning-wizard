# Deep Learning Theory and Programming Tutorials
Our main open-source programming languages and libraries are Python, PyTorch and C++. If you would like a more visual and guided experience, feel free to take our [video course](https://www.udemy.com/practical-deep-learning-with-pytorch/?couponCode=DEEPWIZARD).

## Paths
!!! info "Work-in-progress"
    This open-source portion is still a work in progress. Stay tuned while we gradually upload our tutorials and notes. Feel free to contact [Ritchie Ng](https://www.ritchieng.com/) if you would like to contribute via our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/DeepLearningWizard/) page.
    
    Also take note that these notes are best used as a referral if you are new to deep learning and programming. Go head and take our [video course](https://www.udemy.com/practical-deep-learning-with-pytorch/?couponCode=DEEPWIZARD) that provides a much easier experience.
