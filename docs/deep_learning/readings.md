## Deep Reinforcement Learning
- [An Empirical Analysis of Proximal Policy Optimization with Kronecker-factored Natural Gradients](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.05566.pdf)
	- Shows 2 SOTA for deep RL currently (2018 / early 2019): PPO and ACKTR
	- Attempts to combined PPO objective with K-FAC natural gradient optimization: PPOKFAC
	- Does not improve sample complexity, stick with either PPO/ACKTR for now
