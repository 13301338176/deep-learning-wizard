    "- Autoencoder is a form of **unsupervised learning**.\n",
    "    - This is a big deviation from what we have been doing: classification and regression which are under supervised learning.\n",
    "    - There are no labels required, inputs are used as labels.\n",
    "- Autoencoder's purpose is to learn an approximation of the identity function (mapping $x$ to $\\hat x$).\n",
    "    - Essentially we are trying to learn a function that can take our input $x$ and recreate it $\\hat x$.\n",
    "        - Technically we can do an exact recreation of our input we use a very wide and deep neural network.\n",
