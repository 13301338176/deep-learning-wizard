### Individuals

!!! abstract "Alfredo Canziani"
    Alfredo is the main person who inspired Ritchie to open-source Deep Learning Wizard's materials. We are very grateful for his advice particular in the space of open-source projects, deep learning and PyTorch.
    
    He is currently working as a Post-Doctoral Deep Learning Research Scientist and Lecturer at Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, under the supervision of professors KyungHyun Cho and Yann LeCun.
    
    Do check out his latest [mini-course on PyTorch](https://github.com/Atcold/pytorch-Deep-Learning-Minicourse) that was held in Princeton University and was delivered with Ritchie Ng at AMMI (AIMS) Kigali, Rwanda supported by Google and Facebook.
    
!!! abstract "Marek Bardonski"
    Since graduation, Marek has been working on state-of-the-art research. He was involved in inventing the system that diagnoses problems with Ubuntu packages using Machine Learning and in improving the detection accuracy of breast cancer using Deep Learning, each time leading 40 highly skilled Machine Learning/Deep Learning engineers for over 6 months.

    NASA noticed his unique skills and asked him to manage a project aiming to improve the International Space Station rotation algorithm that would allow them to collect enough power from solar panels while preventing them from overheating. The project was successful and generated a huge ROI for NASA. Marek has been honored by multiple Harvard professors and the Director of Advanced Exploration Systems at NASA, who signed an official Letter of Recommendation.

    Since his first summer of university coursework, Marek has participated in four internships at NVIDIA HQ and Microsoft HQ. He also spent one year in NVIDIA Switzerland optimizing Deep Learning inference for self-driving cars and, by implementing very efficient Deep Learning algorithms in the GPU assembly language, improving the speed of Teslaâ€™s cars self-driving engine inference. He's currently the Head of AI at [Sigmoidal](https://sigmoidal.io/).
